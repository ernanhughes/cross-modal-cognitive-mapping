## Overview

*Cross-Modal Cognitive Mapping* introduces a new framework for understanding human thought across language, vision, and human subjective selection.

By combining text prompts, image generation (via T2I models), human selection behavior, and cross-user resonance mapping, this approach reveals deeper conceptual structures not accessible through language models alone.

This project was developed with the assistance of AI cognitive tools, as part of the methodology itself, reflecting the principle of augmented human-AI collaboration.
